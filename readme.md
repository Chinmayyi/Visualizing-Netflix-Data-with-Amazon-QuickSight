### Understanding Amazon QuickSight

Amazon QuickSight is a cloud-based service that empowers users to quickly analyze and visualize their data. It enables businesses to extract actionable insights, facilitating faster and more informed decisions.
### Project Breakdown

#### 1. Data Preparation with Amazon S3

**Dataset**: The project utilizes a dataset containing detailed information on Netflix's movies and TV shows, including genres, release years, and more.

**S3 Bucket**: The dataset, along with a crucial `manifest.json` file, was uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket. The `manifest.json` file played an essential role in guiding QuickSight to accurately interpret the dataset.![Screenshot 2024-08-28 150622](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf39ef6e-c4f2-47fb-8df9-f3faa59f4489)
#### 2. Setting Up Amazon QuickSight

**Account Setup**: Creating an Amazon QuickSight account was a swift process, taking just a few minutes. 

**Data Access**: QuickSight was configured to access the S3 bucket, ensuring seamless data retrieval.

#### 3. Linking S3 to QuickSight

**Dataset Connection**: A new dataset was created in QuickSight by selecting S3 as the data source and connecting it using the S3 URL linked to the `manifest.json` file. This connection was pivotal for accurate data analysis and visualization.

#### 4. Crafting Visualizations

**Visualization Process**: QuickSight's AutoGraph feature was used to build visualizations. An example visualization showed the distribution of movies versus TV shows by their release year.

#### 5. Applying Filters for Targeted Insights

**Data Filtering**: QuickSight's filtering options allowed for refining the data, such as focusing on content released after 2015. This approach helped in creating more relevant and focused visualizations.

#### 6. Building and Finalizing the Dashboard

**Dashboard Creation**: After creating the visualizations, enhancements were made by adjusting titles and layouts for clarity. Export options, such as converting the dashboard into a PDF, were also explored for easy sharing.
